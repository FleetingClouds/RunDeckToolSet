    This job pushes rundeck,s SSH key to the remote host, creates a "rundeck" admin user, and disables all other access.

    * * This Job is can be run exactly once. * *

    Given a remote host, its SSH fingerprint and the password for root, this Job injects an initial SSH key.  It is RunDeck's public key, to be used for all future interactions between RunDeck and the indicated host.

    Immediately following that a script is pushed to the remote host that does the following : 
     - creates a new user ("rundeck")
     - eliminates UID/PWD logins 
     - moves the authorized keys file from root's account rundeck's account

    The script, thereby prohibiting any future root or UID/PWD logins.
